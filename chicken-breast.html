        <p>A fool proof way to prepare juicy, flavorful simple chicken breastswith minimal
            ingredients!
        </p>

        <!-- Ingredients List -->
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chicken Breasts:</strong> This calls for four skinless, boneless
            chicken breast halves.</li>
            <li><strong>Olive Oil:</strong> Olive oil provides moisture and prevents the chicken 
            breasts from drying out. It also helps the chicken cook more evenly.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt:</strong> Use your favorite coarse sea salt for the most delicious results.</li>
            <li><strong>Creole Seasoning:</strong> Creole seasoning adds flavor and a bit of welcome heat.</li>
            <li><strong>Chicken Broth:</strong> You'll use chicken broth to make an easy pan sauce to pour
            over the baked chicken.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season Chicken: Coat the chicken breasts with olive oil, then sprinkle both sides with salt and Creole seasoning.</li>
            <li>Bake Chicken: Place the seasoned chicken in a broiler pan. Bake in an oven for about 10 minutes, then flip and continue
                to bake for about 15 more minutes (or until the juices run clear). When the chicken is done baking, transfer it to a plate.</li>
            <li>Finish with Pan Sauce: Pour the chicken broth into the pan you used to bake the chicken. Scrape any browned bits off the side
                with a spatula. Drizzle the pan sauce over the baked chicken before serving.
            </li>
        </ol>
